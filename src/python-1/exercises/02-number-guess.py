# Goal: Implement a basic python programme.
# 1. Generate a random number.
# 2. Ask for a guess.
# 3. Check if guess was correct.
# 4. If not, say if number was smaller / larger
# 5. Repeat from step 2, but only 7 times max.

# Hints:
#
# Function "randint(a,b)" from module "random" returns 
# a (pseudo)-random integer N such that a <= N <= b
# 
# Function input("Number?") will promt "Number?" and return 
# the user-input as string
